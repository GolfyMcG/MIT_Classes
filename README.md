# MIT CS Challenge

I'm going to try and teach myself an entire degree's worth of computer science from open courseware. I'm certain it will not be the same as having attended an actual Computer Science program at a top university, but it's free, and it's better than nothing!

###Curriculum & Rules
I've done a minimal amount of research and there are people out there who have built some curricula from open courseware. For now, I'm going to start with all MIT courses, and follow the [MIT Challenge](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/mit-challenge/) by Scott Young. I'll follow the same rules, except I've already "tested" out of some of these courses because I studied Mechanical Engineering at Hopkins and feel there is some definite overlap.

I'm working on [Healthify](www.healthify.us) most of the time, so I won't be doing this anywhere near as quickly or as aggressively, but more as professional development. Here are my adapted rules:

####Rules

1. Everything I do will be posted on my [blog](blog.golfymcg.com) and/or on this repo.
2. I will take notes on every lecture for every class. I'm going to experiment with the [Cornell Method](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/cornellnotes.html). That means posting my original notes, then the following day, reviewing those notes and adding headings and a summary.
3. I will post all of my homework solutions.
4. I must complete the final exam with at least a 60% under the same contraints as a normal student.
5. I will give myself 8 weeks to complete 2 courses at a time.

####Completed Courses:
These are courses that I've either taken already, or I have taken similar distribution requirements for:

I might update this page to reflect changes, but for now, this is my approximate goal. If I find a Stanford alternative, for example, then I might replace a course. I might also find myself struggling to finish in 8 weeks but we'll see! Hopefully this isn't one of the many ill fated blogs/repos that people start and slowly let slip into nothingness...
